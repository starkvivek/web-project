This is a MongoDB connection function using Mongoose. Here's a breakdown:

Functionality:

1. Connects to MongoDB: Uses mongoose.connect() to establish a connection to the MongoDB database.
2. Handles Errors: Catches any errors that occur during connection and logs them to the console.
3. Exits Process: If an error occurs, exits the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code (process.exit(1)).

Key Points:

1. process.env.MONGO_URI: Expects a MongoDB connection string to be set as an environment variable (MONGO_URI).
2. *async/await:* Uses async/await syntax to handle the promise returned by mongoose.connect().
3. *try-catch block:* Catches any errors that occur during connection.

Best Practices:

1. Environment Variables: Using environment variables for sensitive information like connection strings is a good practice.
2. Error Handling: Proper error handling ensures that issues are logged and the process exits cleanly.

Usage:

To use this function, simply import and call it in your main application file (e.g., app.js):


const connectDB = require('./connectDB');
connectDB();


Make sure to set the MONGO_URI environment variable before running your application.
